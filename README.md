 This repository is dedicated to developing a domain-specific Language Model (LLM) for computational physics tasks, starting with the finite element method (FEM).

### Next Steps:

1. **Fine-Tuning a Foundational Model on FEM Literature**
    - **Data Collection**: Collect and preprocess a substantial dataset from finite element method (FEM) literature, including research papers, textbooks, and course materials.
    - **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune an open-source pre-trained model on the collected FEM-specific dataset to specialize it for FEM-related tasks.

2. **Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Contextual Information**
    - **Course Material Integration**: Index FEM course materials (available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJhG_d-Sp_JHKVRhfTgDqbic_4MHpltXZ)) and integrate them into the RAG system to provide context and references for the model.
    - **Contextual Query Handling**: Develop and test the model's ability to retrieve relevant information from the indexed course materials to enhance its responses.
    - **Developing an AI TA App for FEM Course**: Create an AI teaching assistant application specifically for the FEM course to assist students with questions and provide relevant references.

3. **Expanding Beyond FEM**
    - **Broader Domain Coverage**: Expand the scope of the model to cover other areas of computational physics.
    - **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on datasets specific to these new domains, ensuring it gains expertise across a wide range of computational physics topics.

4. **Incorporating New Data Types**
    - **Image Data**: Collect and preprocess relevant images related to computational physics phenomena, such as visualizations of simulation results, graphs, and diagrams.
    - **Simulation Data**: Integrate simulation data from various computational physics models, including chemo-mechanics and electro-chemo-mechanics.
    - **Mathematics and Equations**: Enhance the modelâ€™s ability to understand and manipulate mathematical equations and perform mathematical operations relevant to various domains of computational physics.
