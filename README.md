# AI-University: Finite Element Method
This repository is part of the [AI University (AI-U)](https://my-ai-university.com) initiative. It demonstrates the AI-U framework through a case study on a graduate-level **Finite Element Method (FEM)** course.  \
This repo includes scripts, notebooks, configurations, and raw data to generate training data, fine-tune models, and evaluate the workflow.

### Overview
<img src="ai-u-framework.png" width="700">
We fine-tune a large language model (LLM) using LoRA to create an expert model that responds in the instructor's style. User queries are first answered by this expert model. The expert's response and original user query are then passed to a synthesis model, which retrieves relevant context from course materials using RAG and integrates this context with the expertâ€™s response via an LLM guided by a system prompt, generating an enhanced answer.

### Highlights
- Scalable AI-driven pipeline to generate fine-tuning data, verified by domain experts
- A workflow in which a fine-tuned expert model, **LLaMA-TOMMI-1.0**, feeds into a RAG-based synthesis model, enabling adaptable updates and course-style responses with references
- Web prototype linking AI responses to relevant materials and video timestamps
- Fully open-source stack enabling local deployment and minimizing data privacy risks
