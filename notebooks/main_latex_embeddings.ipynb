      "chunk word length: 525, chunk char length: 3363, chunk = The main constituents of a finite element method for the solution of a boundary-value problem are\\\\ i. The variational or weak statement of the problem; and\\\\ ii. The approximate solution of the variational equations through the use of \"finite element functions.\" To clarify concepts we shall begin with a simple example.\\\\ Suppose we want to solve the following differential equation for $u$ : \\begin{equation*} u_{, x x}+f=0 \\tag{1.1.1} \\end{equation*} where a comma stands for differentiation (i.e., $u_{, x x}=d^{2} u / d x^{2}$ ). We assume $f$ is a given smooth, scalar-valued function defined on the unit interval. We write \\begin{equation*} f: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R} \\tag{1.1.2} \\end{equation*} where $[0,1]$ stands for the unit interval (i.e., the set of points $x$ such that $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ ) and $\\mathbb{R}$ stands for the real numbers. In words, (1.1.2) states that for a given $x$ in $[0,1]$, $f(x)$ is a real number. (Often we will use the notation $\\in$ to mean \"in\" or \"a member of.\" Thus for each $x \\in[0,1], f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$.). Also, $[0,1]$ is said to be the domain of $f$, and $\\mathbb{R}$ is its range. We have described the given function $f$ as being smooth. Intuitively, you probably know what this means. Roughly speaking, if we sketch the graph of the function $f$, we want it to be a smooth curve without discontinuities or kinks. We do this to avoid technical difficulties. Right now we do not wish to elaborate further as this would divert us from the main theme. At some point prior to moving on to the next chapter, the reader may wish to consult Appendix 1.I, \"An Elementary Discussion of Continuity, Differentiability and Smoothness,\" for further remarks on this important aspect of finite element work. The exercise in Sec. 1.16 already uses a little of the language described in Appendix 1.I. The terminology may be somewhat unfamiliar to engineering and physical science students, but it is now widely used in the finite element literature and therefore it is worthwhile to become accustomed to it. Equation (1.1.1) is known to govern the transverse displacement of a string in tension and also the longitudinal displacement of an elastic rod. In these cases, physical parameters, such as the magnitude of tension in the string, or elastic modulus in the case of the rod, appear in (1.1.1). We have omitted these parameters to simplify subsequent developments. Before going on, we introduce a few additional notations and terminologies. Let ]0, 1[ denote the unit interval without end points (i.e., the set of points $x$ such that $0<x<1).] 0,1[$ and $[0,1]$ are referred to as \\textbf{\\textit{open and closed unit intervals,}} respectively. To simplify subsequent writing and tie in with notation employed later on in multidimensional situations, we shall adopt the definitions \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}=] 0,1[ \\quad \\text { (open) } \\tag{1.1.3} \\] \\[ \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}=[0,1] \\quad \\text { (closed) } \\tag{1.1.4} \\] See Fig. 1.1.1. \\begin{figure}[h] \\centering \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-02} \\vspace{0.5em} \\textbf{Figure 1.1.1} \\end{figure} At this point, considerations such as these may seem pedantic. Our purpose, however, is to develop a language for the precise articulation of boundary-value problems, which is necessary for good finite element work.\n",
      "chunk word length: 299, chunk char length: 1996, chunk = A boundary-value problem for (1.1.1) involves imposing \\textbf{\\textit{boundary conditions}} on the function $u$. There are a variety of possibilities. We shall assume $u$ is required to satisfy \\begin{align} u(1) &= g \\tag{1.2.1} \\\\ -u_{, x}(0) &= h \\tag{1.2.2} \\end{align} where $g$ and $h$ are given constants. Equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.2) require that $u$ take on the value $g$ at $x=1$ and the derivative of $u$ (i.e., slope) take on the value $-h$ at $x=0$, respectively. This set of boundary conditions will later enable us to illustrate certain key features of variational formulations. For obvious reasons, boundary conditions of the type (1.2.1) and (1.2.2) lead to so-called \\textbf{\\textit{two-point boundary-value problems.}} The strong form of the boundary-value problem, $(S)$, is stated as follows: \\[ \\text{(S)} \\quad \\left\\{ \\parbox{0.8\\textwidth}{ \\text{Given } $f:\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ \\text{ and constants } $g$ \\text{ and } $h$, \\text{ find } $u:\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, \\text{ such that:} \\begin{align*} u_{,xx} + f &= 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\Omega \\\\ u(1) &= g \\\\ -u_{,x}(0) &= h \\end{align*} } \\right. \\] When we write $u_{, x x}+f=0$ on $\\Omega$ we mean $u_{, x x}(x)+f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$. Of course, the exact solution of $(S)$ is trivial to obtain, namely, \\begin{equation*} u(x)=g+(1-x) h+\\int_{x}^{1}\\left\\{\\int_{0}^{y} f(z) d z\\right\\} d y \\tag{1.2.3} \\end{equation*} where $y$ and $z$ are used to denote dummy variables. However, this is not the main concern here. We are interested in developing schemes for obtaining approximate solutions to ( $S$ ) that will be applicable to much more complex situations in which exact solutions are not possible. Some methods of approximation begin directly with the strong statement of the problem. The most notable example is the finite difference method (e.g., see [1]). The finite element method requires a different formulation, which is treated in the next section.\n",
      "chunk word length: 445, chunk char length: 3162, chunk = To define the weak, or variational, counterpart of ( $S$ ), we need to characterize two classes of functions. The first is to be composed of candidate, or trial, solutions. From the outset, we shall require these possible solutions to satisfy the boundary condition $u(1)=g$. The other boundary condition will not be required in the definition. Furthermore, so that certain expressions to be employed make sense, we shall require that the derivatives of the trial solutions be square-integrable. That is, if $u$ is a trial solution, then \\begin{equation*} \\int_{0}^{1}(u_{,x})^{2} d x<\\infty \\tag{1.3.1} \\end{equation*} Functions that satisfy (1.3.1) are called $H^{1}$-functions; we write $\\boldsymbol{u} \\in \\boldsymbol{H}^{1}$. Sometimes the domain is explicitly included, i.e., $u \\in H^{1}([0,1])$. Thus the collection of trial solutions, denoted by $\\mathfrak{f}$, consists of all functions which have square-integrable derivatives and take on the value $q$ at $x=1$. This is written as follows: \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{S}=\\left\\{u \\mid u \\in H^{1}, u(1)=g\\right\\} \\quad \\text { (trial solutions) } \\tag{1.3.2} \\end{equation*} The fact that $\\mathfrak{f}$ is a collection, or set, of objects is indicated by the curly brackets (called braces) in (1.3.2). The notation for the typical member of the set, in this case $u$, comes first inside the left-hand curly bracket. Following the vertical line ( $\\mid$ ) are the properties satisfied by members of the set. The second collection of functions is called the \\textbf{\\textit{weighting functions}}, or \\textbf{\\textit{variations}}. This collection is very similar to the trial solutions except we require the homogeneous counterpart of the $g$-boundary condition. That is, we require weighting functions, $w$, to satisfy $w(1)=0$. The collection is denoted by $\\mathcal{U}$ and defined by\\\\ \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{U} = \\{w \\mid w \\in H^{1}, w(1)=0\\} \\quad \\text{(weighting functions)} \\tag{1.3.3} \\end{equation*} It simplifies matters somewhat to continue to think of $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ as being smooth. (However, what follows holds for a considerably larger class of $f$'s.) In terms of the preceding definitions, we may now state a suitable weak form, $(W)$, of the boundary-value problem. \\[ (\\mathcal{W}) \\quad \\left\\{ \\parbox{0.8\\textwidth}{ \\text{Given } $f,$q and $h$,\\text{ as before. Find } $u \\in \\mathfrak{f}$, \\text{ such that for all} \\mbox{$w \\in \\mathcal{U}$} \\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x=\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x+w(0) h \\tag{1.3.4} \\end{align*} } \\right. \\] Formulations of this type are often called \\textbf{\\textit{virtual work}}, or \\textbf{\\textit{virtual displacement, principles}} in mechanics. The $w$'s are the \\textbf{\\textit{virtual displacements}}. Equation (1.3.4) is called the \\textbf{\\textit{variational equation}}, or (especially in mechanics) the \\textbf{\\textit{equation of virtual work.}} The solution of $(W)$ is called the \\textbf{\\textit{weak}}, or \\textbf{\\textit{generalized, solution}}. The definition given of a weak formulation is not the only one possible, but it is the most natural one for the problems we wish to consider.\n",
      "chunk word length: 571, chunk char length: 3826, chunk = Clearly, there must be some relationship between the strong and weak versions of the problem, or else there would be no point in introducing the weak form. It turns out that the weak and strong solutions are identical. We shall establish this assuming all functions are smooth. This will allow us to proceed expeditiously without invoking technical conditions with which the reader is assumed to be unfamiliar. \"Proofs\" of this kind are sometimes euphemistically referred to as \"formal proofs.\" The intent is not to be completely rigorous but rather to make plausible the truth of the proposition. With this philosophy in mind, we shall \"prove\" the following. \\subsection*{Proposition} a. Let $u$ be a solution of (S). Then $u$ is also a solution of (W).\\\\ b. Let $u$ be a solution of $(W)$. Then $u$ is also a solution of $(S)$. Another result, which we shall not bother to verify but is in fact easily established, is that both $(S)$ and $(W)$ possess unique solutions. Thus, by (a) and (b), the strong and weak solutions are one and the same. Consequently, $(W)$ is equivalent to $(S)$. \\subsection*{Formal Proof} \\bfseries{a}. Since $u$ is assumed to be a solution of (S), we may write \\begin{equation*} 0=-\\int_{0}^{1} w(u_{, x x}+f) d x \\tag{1.4.1} \\end{equation*} for any $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Integrating (1.4.1) by parts results in \\begin{equation*} 0=\\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x-\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x-\\left.w u_{, x}\\right|_{0} ^{1} \\tag{1.4.2} \\end{equation*} Rearranging and making use of the fact that $-u_{. x}(0)=h$ and $w(1)=0$ results in \\begin{equation*} \\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x=\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x+w(0) h \\tag{1.4.3} \\end{equation*} Furthermore, since $u$ is a solution of $(S)$, it satisfies $u(1)=g$ and therefore is in $\\mathfrak{f}$. Finally, since $u$ also satisfies (1.4.3) for all $w \\in \\mathcal{U}, u$ satisfies the definition of a weak solution given by ( $W$ ).\\\\ \\\\ b. Now $u$ is assumed to be a weak solution. Thus $u \\in \\mathcal{S}$; consequently $u(1)=g$, and $$ \\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x=\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x+w(0) h $$ for all $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Integrating by parts and making use of the fact $w(1)=0$ results in \\begin{equation*} 0=\\int_{0}^{1} w\\left(u_{, x x}+f\\right) d x+w(0)\\left[u_{, x}(0)+h\\right]. \\tag{1.4.4} \\end{equation*} To prove $u$ is a solution of $(S)$ it suffices to show that (1.4.4) implies ${ }^{1}$\\\\ i. $u_{, x x}+f=0$ on $\\Omega$; and\\\\ ii. $u_{, x}(0)+h=0$ First we shall prove (i). Define $\\boldsymbol{w}$ in (1.4.4) by \\begin{equation*} w=\\phi\\left(u_{, x x}+f\\right) \\tag{1.4.5} \\end{equation*} where $\\phi$ is smooth; $\\phi(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega=] 0,1[$; and $\\phi(0)=\\phi(1)=0$. For example, we can take $\\phi(x)=x(1-x)$, which satisfies all the stipulated requirements (see Figure 1.4.1). It follows that $w(1)=0$ and thus $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$, so (1.4.5) defines a\\\\ \\begin{figure}[h] \\centering \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-05} \\vspace{0.5em} \\textbf{Figure 1.4.1} \\end{figure} \\footnotetext{${ }^{1}$ These equations are sometimes called the Euler-Lagrange equations of the weak formulation. } legitimate member of $\\mathcal{U}$. Substituting (1.4.5) into (1.4.4) results in\\\\ \\begin{equation*} 0=\\int_{0}^{1} \\phi \\underbrace{\\left(u_{, x x}+f\\right)^{2}}_{\\geq 0} d x+0 \\tag{1.4.6} \\end{equation*} Since $\\phi>0$ on $\\Omega$, it follows from (1.4.6) that (i) must be satisfied.\\\\ Now that we have established (i), we may use it in (1.4.4) to prove (ii), namely, \\begin{equation*} 0=w(0)\\left[u_{, x}(0)+h\\right] \\tag{1.4.7} \\end{equation*} That $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$ puts no restriction whatsoever on its value at $x=0$. Therefore, we may assume that the $w$ in (1.4.7) is such that $w(0) \\neq 0$. Thus (ii) is also shown to hold, which completes the proof of the proposition.\n",
      "chunk word length: 468, chunk char length: 3228, chunk = \\begin{enumerate} \\item The boundary condition $-u_{, x}(0)=h$ is not explicitly mentioned in the statement of ( $W$ ). From the preceding proof, we see that this boundary condition is, however, implied by the satisfaction of the variational equation. Boundary conditions of this type are referred to as \\textbf{\\textit{natural boundary conditions}}. On the other hand, trial solutions are explicitly required to satisfy the boundary condition $u(1)=g$. Boundary conditions of this type are called \\textbf{\\textit{essential boundary conditions}}. The fact that solutions of the variational equation satisfy natural boundary conditions is extremely important in more complicated situations which we will consider later on. \\item The method used to prove part (b) of the proposition goes under the name of the \\textbf{\\textit{fundamental lemma}} in the literature of the calculus of variations. In essence, it is the methodology that enables us to deduce the differential equations and boundary conditions implied by the weak formulation. To develop correct weak forms for complex, multidimensional problems, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these procedures. \\end{enumerate} Now we see that to obtain approximate solutions to the original boundary-value problem we have alternative starting points, i.e., the strong or weak statements of the problem. Finite element methods are based upon the latter. Roughly speaking, the basic idea is to approximate $f$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ by convenient, finite-dimensional collections of functions. (Clearly, $f$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ contain infinitely many functions.) The variational equations are then solved in this finite-dimensional context. An explicit example of how to go about this is the subject of the next section. However, we first introduce some additional notations to simplify subsequent writing. Let \\begin{align*} a(w, u) & =\\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x \\tag{1.4.8}\\\\ (w, f) & =\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x \\tag{1.4.9} \\end{align*} In terms of (1.4.8) and (1.4.9), the variational equation takes the form \\begin{equation*} a(w, u)=(w, f)+w(0) h \\tag{1.4.10} \\end{equation*} Here, $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ are examples of \\textbf{\\textit{symmetric, bilinear forms}}. What this means is as follows: Let $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ be constants and let $u, v$, and $w$ be functions. Then the symmetry property is \\begin{align*} a(u, v) & =a(v, u) \\tag{1.4.11}\\\\ (u, v) & =(v, u) \\tag{1.4.12} \\end{align*} Bilinearity means linearity in each \"slot\"; for example, \\begin{align*} a\\left(c_{1} u+c_{2} v, w\\right) & =c_{1} a(u, w)+c_{2} a(v, w) \\tag{1.4.13}\\\\ \\left(c_{1} u+c_{2} v, w\\right) & =c_{1}(u, w)+c_{2}(v, w) \\tag{1.4.14} \\end{align*} \\\\ Exercise 1. Use the definitions of $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ to verify the properties of symmetry and bilinearity.\\\\ The above notations are very concise; at the same time they capture essential mathematical features and thus are conducive to a mathematical understanding of variational and finite element methods. Diverse classes of physical problems can be written in essentially similar fashion to (1.4.10). Thus ideas developed and results obtained are seen at once to have very broad applicability.\n",
      "chunk word length: 342, chunk char length: 2364, chunk = We shall now describe a method of obtaining approximate solutions to boundary-value problems based upon weak formulations. Our introduction to this subject is somewhat of an abstract treatment. However, the meaning should be significantly reinforced by the remaining sections of the chapter. It may be worthwhile for the reader to consult this section again after completing the rest of the chapter to make sure a full comprehension of the material is attained. The first step in developing the method is to construct finite-dimensional approximations of $f$ and $\\mathcal{U}$. These collections of functions are denoted by $f^{h}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$, respectively. The superscript refers to the association of $f^{h}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ with a \\textit{\\textbf{mesh}}, or \\textit{\\textbf{discretization}}, of the domain $\\Omega$, which is parameterized by a characteristic length scale $h$. We wish to think of $f^{h}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ as being subsets of $f$ and $\\mathcal{U}$, respectively. This is written as \\begin{align*} f^{h} \\subset f & \\text { (i.e., if } \\left.u^{h} \\in f^{h}, \\text { then } u^{h} \\in f\\right) \\tag{1.5.1}\\\\ \\mathcal{U}^{h} \\subset \\mathcal{U} & \\text { (i.e., if } w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}, \\text { then } w^{h} \\in\\mathcal{U}) \\tag{1.5.2} \\end{align*} where the precise meaning is given in parentheses. ${ }^{2}$ Consequences of (1.5.1) and (1.5.2) are (respectively) that if $u^{h} \\in f^{h}$ and $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$, then \\begin{align*} & u^{h}(1)=q \\tag{1.5.3}\\\\ & w^{h}(1)=0 \\tag{1.5.4} \\end{align*} The collections, $f, \\mathcal{U}, d^{h}$, and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$, are often referred to as \\textit{\\textbf{function space}}. The terminology space in mathematics usually connotes a linear structure. This has the following meaning: If $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants and $v$ and $w$ are in $\\mathcal{U}$, then $c_{1} v+c_{2} w$ is also in $\\mathcal{U}$. Both $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ are thus seen to possess the property of a linear space. However, this property is clearly not shared by $f$ and $f^{h}$ due to the inhomogeneous boundary condition. For example, if $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ are members of $f$, then $u_{1}+u_{2} \\notin f$, since $u_{1}(1)+u_{2}(1)=g+g=2 g$ in violation of the definition of $f$. Nevertheless, the terminology function space is still (loosely) applied to $f$ and $f^{h}$.\n",
      "chunk word length: 500, chunk char length: 3655, chunk = Assume the collection $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ is given. Then, to each member $v^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$, we construct a function $u^{h} \\in f^{h}$ by \\begin{equation*} u^{h}=v^{h}+g^{h} \\tag{1.5.5} \\end{equation*} where $g^{\\boldsymbol{h}}$ is a given function satisfying the essential boundary condition, i.e., \\begin{equation*} g^{h}(1)=g \\tag{1.5.6} \\end{equation*} Note that (1.5.5) satisfies the requisite boundary condition also: \\begin{align*} u^{h}(1) & =v^{h}(1)+g^{h}(1) \\tag{1.5.7}\\\\ & =0+g \\end{align*} Thus (1.5.5) constitutes a definition of $f^{h}$; that is, $f^{h}$ is all functions of the form (1.5.5). The key point to observe is that, up to the function $g^{h}, f^{h}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ are composed of identical collections of functions. This property will be shown later on to have significant consequences for certain classes of problems. We now write a variational equation, of the form of (1.4.10), in terms of $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{W}^{h}$ and $u^{h} \\in \\delta^{h}$ \\begin{equation*} a\\left(w^{h}, u^{h}\\right)=\\left(w^{h}, A\\right)+w^{h}(0) h \\tag{1.5.8} \\end{equation*} This equation is to be thought of as defining an approximate (weak) solution, $u^{\\boldsymbol{h}}$. \\footnotetext{${ }^{2}$ This condition may be considered standard. However, it is often violated in practice. Strang [2] coined the terminology \"variational crimes\" to apply to this, and other, situations in which the classical rules of variational methods are violated. Many \"variational crimes\" have been given a rigorous mathematical basis (e.g., see [2]). We shall have more to say about this subject in subsequent chapters. }Substitution of (1.5.5) into (1.5.8), and the bilinearity of $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ enables us to write \\begin{equation*} a\\left(w^{h}, v^{h}\\right)=\\left(w^{h}, f\\right)+w^{h}(0) h-a\\left(w^{h}, g^{h}\\right) \\tag{1.5.9} \\end{equation*} The right-hand side consists of the totality of terms associated with given data (i.e., $f, q$, and $h$ ). Equation (1.5.9) is to be used to define $v^{h}$, the unknown part of $u^{h}$. The (Bubnov-) Galerkin form of the problem, denoted by ( $G$ ), is stated as follows:\\\\ \\[ \\text{(G)} \\quad \\left\\{ \\parbox{0.8\\textwidth}{ \\text { Given } $f, q$, \\text { and } $h$, \\text {, as before, find } $u^{h}=v^{h}+q^{h}$ \\text {, where } $v^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$ \\text { such that for all } $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$ \\\\ \\begin{align*} a\\left(w^{h}, v^{h}\\right)=\\left(w^{h}, f\\right)+w^{h}(0) h-a\\left(w^{h}, g^{h}\\right) \\end{align*} } \\right. \\] Note that $(G)$ is just a version of $(W)$ posed in terms of a finite-dimensional collection of functions, namely, $\\mathcal{U}^\\text{h}$. To make matters more specific, $g^{h}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ have to be explicitly defined. Before doing this, it is worthwhile to mention a larger class of approximation methods, called \\textit{\\textbf{Petrov-Galerkin methods}}, in which $v^{h}$ is contained in a collection of functions other than $\\mathcal{U^\\text{h}}$. Recent attention has been paid to methods of this type, especially in the context of fluid mechanics. For the time being, we will be exclusively concerned with the Bubnov-Galerkin method. The Bubnov-Galerkin method is commonly referred to as simply the Galerkin method, terminology we shall adopt henceforth. Equation (1.5.9) is sometimes referred to as the \\textit{\\textbf{Galerkin equation.}} Approximation methods of the type considered are examples of so-called \\textit{\\textbf{weighted residual methods}}. The standard reference dealing with this subject is Finlayson [3]. For a more succinct presentation containing an interesting historical account, see Finlayson and Scriven [4].\n",
      "chunk word length: 686, chunk char length: 5347, chunk = The Galerkin method leads to a coupled system of linear algebraic equations. To see this we need to give further structure to the definition of $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$. Let $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ consist of all linear combinations of given functions denoted by $N_{A}: \\bar{\\Omega} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, where $A=1,2, \\ldots, n$. By this we mean that if $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$, then there exist constants $c_{A}, A=1,2, \\ldots, n$, such that \\begin{align*} w^{h} & =\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A} \\\\ & =c_{1} N_{1}+c_{2} N_{2}+\\cdots+c_{n} N_{n} \\tag{1.6.1} \\end{align*} The $N_{A}$ 's are referred to as shape, basis, or interpolation functions. We require that each $N_{A}$ satisfies \\begin{equation*} N_{A}(1)=0, \\quad A=1,2, \\ldots, n \\tag{1.6.2} \\end{equation*} from which it follows by (1.6.1) that $w^{h}(1)=0$, as is necessary. $W^{h}$ is said to have dimension $n$, for obvious reasons. To define members of $\\delta^{h}$ we need to specify $g^{h}$. To this end, we introduce another shape function, $N_{n+1}: \\bar{\\Omega} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, which has the property \\begin{equation*} N_{n+1}(1)=1 \\tag{1.6.3} \\end{equation*} (Note $N_{n+1} \\notin \\mathcal{U}^{h}$. ) Then $g^{h}$ is given by \\begin{equation*} g^{h}=g N_{n+1} \\tag{1.6.4} \\end{equation*} and thus \\begin{equation*} g^{h}(1)=g \\tag{1.6.5} \\end{equation*} With these definitions, a typical $u^{h} \\in f^{h}$ may be written as \\begin{align*} u^{h} & =v^{h}+g^{h} \\\\ & =\\sum_{A=1}^{n} d_{A} N_{A}+g N_{n+1} \\tag{1.6.6} \\end{align*} where the $d_{A}$ 's are constants and from which it is apparent that $u^{h}(1)=g$.\\\\ Substitution of (1.6.1) and (1.6.6) into the Galerkin equation yields \\begin{align*} a\\left(\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A}, \\sum_{B=1}^{n} d_{B} N_{B}\\right)=\\left(\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A}, f\\right)+ & {\\left[\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A}(0)\\right] h } \\\\ & -a\\left(\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A}, g N_{n+1}\\right) \\tag{1.6.7} \\end{align*} By using the bilinearity of $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $(\\cdot, \\cdot),(1.6 .7)$ becomes \\begin{equation*} 0=\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} G_{A} \\tag{1.6.8} \\end{equation*} where \\begin{equation*} G_{A}=\\sum_{B=1}^{n} a\\left(N_{A}, N_{B}\\right) d_{B}-\\left(N_{A}, f\\right)-N_{A}(0) h+a\\left(N_{A}, N_{n+1}\\right) q \\tag{1.6.9} \\end{equation*} Now the Galerkin equation is to hold for all $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$. By (1.6.1), this means for all $c_{A}$'s, $A=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Since the $c_{A}$'s are arbitrary in (1.6.8), it necessarily follows that each $G_{A}, A=1,2, \\ldots, n$, must be identically zero, i.e., from (1.6.9) \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{B=1}^{n} a\\left(N_{A}, N_{B}\\right) d_{B}=\\left(N_{A}, f\\right)+N_{A}(0) h-a\\left(N_{A}, N_{n+1}\\right) g \\tag{1.6.10} \\end{equation*} Note that everything is known in (1.6.10) except the $d_{B}$ 's. Thus (1.6.10) constitutes a system of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns. This can be written in a more concise form as follows: Let \\begin{align*} K_{A B} & =a\\left(N_{A}, N_{B}\\right) \\tag{1.6.11}\\\\ F_{A} & =\\left(N_{A}, f\\right)+N_{A}(0) h-a\\left(N_{A}, N_{n+1}\\right) g \\tag{1.6.12} \\end{align*} Then (1.6.10) becomes \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{B=1}^{n} K_{A B} d_{B}=F_{A}, \\quad A=1,2, \\ldots, n \\tag{1.6.13} \\end{equation*} Further simplicity is gained by adopting a matrix notation. Let \\begin{align*} & \\boldsymbol{K}=\\left[K_{A B}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} K_{11} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{12} & \\cdots & K_{1 n} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{K}_{21} & K_{22} & \\cdots & K_{2 n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\ K_{n 1} & K_{n 2} & \\cdots & K_{n n} \\end{array}\\right] \\tag{1.6.14}\\\\ & \\boldsymbol{F}=\\left\\{F_{A}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c} F_{1} \\\\ F_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ F_{n} \\end{array}\\right\\} \\tag{1.6.15} \\end{align*} and \\[ d=\\left\\{d_{B}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c} d_{1} \\tag{1.6.16}\\\\ d_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ d_{n} \\end{array}\\right\\} \\] Now (1.6.13) may be written as \\begin{equation*} \\boldsymbol{K} \\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{F} \\tag{1.6.17} \\end{equation*} The following terminologies are frequently applied, especially when the problem under consideration pertains to a mechanical system: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{K} & =\\text { stiffness matrix } \\\\ \\boldsymbol{F} & =\\text { force vector } \\\\ \\boldsymbol{d} & =\\text { displacement vector } \\end{aligned} $$ A variety of physical interpretations are of course possible. At this point, we may state the matrix equivalent, $(M)$, of the Galerkin problem.\\\\ (M) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Given the coefficient matrix } \\boldsymbol{K} \\text { and vector } \\boldsymbol{F}, \\text { find } \\boldsymbol{d} \\text { such that } \\\\ \\boldsymbol{K} \\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{F}\\end{array}\\right.$ The solution of $(M)$ is, of course, just $d=K^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F}$ (assuming the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{K}$, $K^{-1}$, exists). Once $d$ is known, the solution of ( $G$ ) may be obtained at any point $x \\in \\bar{\\Omega}$ by employing (1.6.6), viz., \\begin{equation*} u^{h}(x)=\\sum_{A=1}^{n} d_{A} N_{A}(x)+g N_{n+1}(x) \\tag{1.6.18} \\end{equation*} Likewise, derivatives of $u^{h}$, if required, may be obtained by term-by-term differentiation. It should be emphasized, that the solution of $(G)$ is an approximate solution of ( $W$ ). Consequently, the differential equation and natural boundary condition are only approximately satisfied. The quality of the approximation depends upon the specific choice of $N_{A}$ 's and the number $n$.\n",

The functions employed are extremely simple, thus expediting computations, but they are also primitive examples of typical finite element functions. \\subsection*{Example 1 (1 degree of freedom)} In this case $n=1$. Thus $w^{h}=c_{1} N_{1}$ and $u^{h}=v^{h}+g^{h}=d_{1} N_{1}+g N_{2}$. The only unknown is $d_{1}$. The shape functions must satisfy $N_{1}(1)=0$ and $N_{2}(1)=1$ (see (1.6.2) and (1.6.3)). Let us take $N_{1}(x)=1-x$ and $N_{2}(x)=x$. These are illustrated in Fig. 1.7.1 and clearly satisfy the required conditions. Since we are dealing with only 1 degree of freedom, the matrix paraphernalia collapses as follows: \\begin{align*} K & =\\left[K_{11}\\right]=K_{11} \\tag{1.7.1}\\\\ F & =\\left\\{F_{1}\\right\\}=F_{1} \\tag{1.7.2}\\\\ d & =\\left\\{d_{1}\\right\\}=d_{1} \\tag{1.7.3}\\\\ K_{11} & =a\\left(N_{1}, N_{1}\\right)=\\int_{0}^{1} \\underbrace{N_{1,x}}_{-1} \\underbrace{N_{1, x}}_{-1} d x=1 \\tag{1.7.4}\\\\ F_{1} & =\\left(N_{1}, f\\right)+N_{1}(0) h-a\\left(N_{1}, N_{2}\\right) q \\\\ & =\\int_{0}^{1}(1-x) f(x) d x+h-\\int_{0}^{1} \\underbrace{N_{1, x}}_{-1} \\underbrace{N_{2, x}}_{+1} d x g \\\\ & =\\int_{0}^{1}(1-x) f(x) d x+h+q \\tag{1.7.5}\\\\ d_{1} & =K_{11}^{-1} F_{1}=F_{1} \\tag{1.7.6} \\end{align*} Consequently \\begin{equation*} u^{h}(x)=[\\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y) f(y) d y+h+g}_{d_{1}}](1-x)+g x \\tag{1.7.7} \\end{equation*} In (1.7.7), $y$ plays the role of a dummy variable. An illustration of (1.7.7) appears in Fig. 1.7.2. To get a feel for the nature of the approximation, let us compare (1.7.7) with the exact solution (see (1.2.3)). It is helpful to consider specific forms for $f$.\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-14(1)} Figure 1.7.1 Functions for the 1 degree of freedom examples.

In fact, it is clear by inspecting (1.7.7) and (1.2.3) that the homogeneous solution (i.e., the part of the solution corresponding to $f=0$ ) is always exactly represented. The only approximation pertains to the particular solution (i.e., the part of the solution corresponding to $f \\neq 0$ ).\\\\ \\\\ ii. Now let us introduce a nonzero $f$.

      "chunk word length: 680, chunk char length: 5021, chunk = The examples of the preceding section employed definitions of $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ and $f^{h}$ which were special cases of the so-called piecewise linear finite element space. To define the general case in which $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ is $n$-dimensional, we partition the domain [0,1] into $n$ nonoverlapping subintervals. The typical subinterval is denoted by $\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$, where $x_{A}<x_{A+1}$ and $A=1,2, \\ldots, n$. We also require $x_{1}=0$ and $x_{n+1}=1$. The $x_{A}$ 's are called nodal points, or simply nodes. (The terminologies joints and knots are also used.) The subintervals are sometimes referred to as the finite element domains, or simply elements. Notice that the lengths of the elements, $h_{A}=x_{A+1}-x_{A}$, are not required to be equal. The mesh parameter, $h$, is generally taken to be the length of the maximum subinterval (i.e., $h=\\max h_{A}, A=1,2, \\ldots, n$ ). The smaller $h$, the more \"refined\" is the partition, or mesh. If the subinterval lengths are equal, then $h=1 / n$. The shape functions are defined as follows: Associated to a typical internal node (i.e., $2 \\leq A \\leq n$ ) \\[ N_{A}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{\\left(x-x_{A-1}\\right)}{h_{A-1}}, & x_{A-1} \\leq x \\leq x_{A} \\tag{1.8.1}\\\\ \\frac{\\left(x_{A+1}-x\\right)}{h_{A}}, & x_{A} \\leq x \\leq x_{A+1} \\\\ 0, & \\text { elsewhere } \\end{array}\\right. \\] whereas for the boundary nodes we have \\begin{align*} & N_{1}(x)=\\frac{x_{2}-x}{h_{1}}, \\quad x_{1} \\leq x \\leq x_{2} \\tag{1.8.2}\\\\ & N_{n+1}(x)=\\frac{x-x_{n}}{h_{n}}, \\quad x_{n} \\leq x \\leq x_{n+1} \\tag{1.8.3} \\end{align*} The shape functions are sketched in Fig. 1.8.1. For obvious reasons, they are referred to variously as \"hat,\" \"chapeau,\" and \"roof\" functions. Note that $N_{A}\\left(x_{B}\\right)=\\delta_{A B}$, where\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-21} Figure 1.8.1 Basis functions for the piecewise linear finite element space.\\\\ $\\delta_{A B}$ is the Kronecker delta (i.e., $\\delta_{A B}=1$ if $A=B$, whereas $\\delta_{A B}=0$ if $A \\neq B$ ). In words, $N_{A}$ takes on the value 1 at node $A$ and is 0 at all other nodes. Furthermore, $N_{A}$ is nonzero only in the subintervals that contain $x_{A}$. A typical member $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$ has the form $\\sum_{A=1}^{n} c_{A} N_{A}$ and appears as in Fig. 1.8.2. Note that $w^{\\boldsymbol{h}}$ is continuous but has discontinuous slope across each element boundary. For this reason, $w_{, x}^{h}$, the generalized derivative of $w^{h}$, will be piecewise constant, experiencing discontinuities across element boundaries. (Such a function is sometimes called a generalized step function.) Restricted to each element domain, $w^{h}$ is a linear polynomial in $x$. In respect to the homogeneous essential boundary condition, $w^{h}(1)=0$. Clearly, $w^{h}$ is identically zero if and only if each $c_{A}=0, A=1,2$, . . . , $\\boldsymbol{n}$.\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-21(1)} Figure 1.8.2 A typical member $w^{\\boldsymbol{h}} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{\\boldsymbol{k}}$.\\\\ Typical members of $f^{h}$ are obtained by adding $g^{h}=g N_{n+1}$ to typical members of $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$. This ensures that $u^{h}(1)=g$. The piecewise linear finite element functions are the simplest and most widely used finite element functions for one-dimensional problems. Exercise 1. Consider the weak formulation of the one-dimensional model problem: \\begin{equation*} \\int_{0}^{1} w_{, x} u_{, x} d x=\\int_{0}^{1} w f d x+w(0) h \\tag{1.8.4} \\end{equation*} where $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $u \\in f$ are assumed to be smooth on element interiors (i.e., on $] x_{A}$, $x_{A+1}[, A=1,2, \\ldots, n)$, but may suffer slope discontinuities across element boundaries. (Functions of this class contain the piecewise linear finite element space described earlier.) From (1.8.4) and the assumed continuity of the functions, show that: \\begin{align*} 0= & \\sum_{A=1}^{n} \\int_{x_{A}}^{x_{A}+1} w\\left(u_{, x x}+f\\right) d x+w(0)\\left[u_{, x}\\left(0^{+}\\right)+h\\right] \\\\ & +\\sum_{A=2}^{n} w\\left(x_{A}\\right)\\left[u_{, x}\\left(x_{A}^{+}\\right)-u_{, x}\\left(x_{A}^{-}\\right)\\right] \\tag{1.8.5} \\end{align*} Arguing as in Sec. 1.4, it may be concluded that the Euler-Lagrange conditions of (1.8.5) are\\\\ i. $u_{, x x}(x)+f(x)=0$, where $\\left.x \\in\\right] x_{A}, x_{A+1}[$ and $A=1,2, \\ldots, n$,\\\\ ii. $-u_{, x}\\left(0^{+}\\right)=h$; and\\\\ iii. $u_{, x}\\left(x_{A}^{-}\\right)=u_{, x}\\left(x_{A}^{+}\\right)$, where $A=2,3, \\ldots, n$. Observe that (i) is the differential equation restricted to element interiors, and (iii) is a continuity condition across element boundaries. This may be contrasted with the case in which the solution is assumed smooth. In this case the continuity condition is identically satisfied and the summation of integrals over element interiors may be replaced by an integral over the entire domain (see Sec. 1.4). In the Galerkin finite element formulation, an approximate solution of (i)-(iii) is obtained.\n",
      "chunk word length: 433, chunk char length: 3075, chunk = The shape functions $N_{A}, A=1,2, \\ldots, n+1$, are zero outside a neighborhood of node $A$.

The $\\boldsymbol{n} \\times n$ matrix $K$ defined by (1.6.11) is positive definite.\\\\ Proof\\\\ i. Let $c_{A}, A=1,2, \\ldots, n$, be the components of $c$ (i.e., $c=\\left\\{c_{A}\\right\\}$ ), an arbitrary vector.

Assume $c^{T} K c=0$. By the proof of part (i), $$ \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(w_{, x}^{h}\\right)^{2} d x=0 $$ and consequently $w^{h}$ must be constant. Since $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}, w^{h}(1)=0$. Combining these facts, we conclude that $w^{h}(x)=0$ for all $x \\in[0,1]$, which is possible only if each $c_{A}=0, A=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Thus $c=0$. Note that part (ii) depended upon the definition of $\\boldsymbol{K}$ and the zero essential boundary condition built into the definition of $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$.

      "chunk word length: 858, chunk char length: 6304, chunk = In this section we will show that the observations made with reference to the example problems of Sec. 1.7 are, in fact, general results. To establish these facts rigorously requires only elementary mathematical techniques. Our first objective is to establish that the Galerkin finite element solution $\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\boldsymbol{h}}$ is exact at the nodes. To do this we must introduce the notion of a Green's function. Let $\\delta_{y}(x)=\\delta(x-y)$ denote the Dirac delta function. The Dirac function is not a function in the classical sense but rather an operator defined by its action on (continuous) functions. Let $w$ be continuous on $[0,1]$; then we write \\begin{align*} \\left(w, \\delta_{y}\\right) & =\\int_{0}^{1} w(x) \\delta(x-y) d x \\tag{1.10.1}\\\\ & =w(y) \\end{align*} By (1.10.1), we see why attention is restricted to continuous functions- $\\delta$, sifts out the value of $w$ at $y$. If $w$ were discontinuous at $y$, its value would be ambiguous. In mechanics, we think of $\\delta_{y}$, visually as representing a concentrated force of unit amplitude located at point $y$. The Green's function problem corresponding to ( $S$ ) may be stated as follows: Find a function $g$ (i.e., the Green's function) such that \\begin{align*} g_{, x x}+\\delta_{y} & =0 \\quad \\text { on } \\Omega \\tag{1.10.2}\\\\ g(1) & =0 \\tag{1.10.3}\\\\ g_{, x}(0) & =0 \\tag{1.10.4} \\end{align*} Note that (1.10.2)-(1.10.4) are simply $(S)$ in which $f$ is replaced by $\\delta_{y}$, and $q$ and $h$ are taken to be zero. This problem may be solved by way of formal calculations with distributions, or generalized functions, such as $\\delta_{y}$. (The theory of distributions is dealt with in Stakgold [5]. A good elementary account of formal calculations with distributions is presented in Popov [9]. This latter reference is recommended to readers having had no previous experience with this topic.) To this end we note that the (formal) integral of $\\delta_{y}$ is the Heaviside, or unit step, function: \\[ H_{y}(x)=H(x-y)= \\begin{cases}0, & x<y \\tag{1.10.5}\\\\ 1, & x>y\\end{cases} \\] The integral of $\\dot{H}_{y}$ is the Macaulay bracket: \\[ \\langle x-y\\rangle=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl} 0, & x \\leq y \\tag{1.10.6}\\\\ x-y, & x>y \\end{array}\\right. \\] The preceding functions are depicted in Fig. 1.10.1.\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-25(1)}\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-25(2)}\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-25} Figure 1.10.1 Elementary generalized functions (distributions).

Evaluation of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ is performed by requiring (1.10.7) and (1.10.8) to satisfy the boundary conditions. This results in (see Fig. 1.10.2) \\begin{equation*} g(x)=(1-y)-\\langle x-y\\rangle \\tag{1.10.9} \\end{equation*} Observe that $g$ is piecewise linear.

This can be deduced from ( $W$ ) by replacing $u$ by $g, f$ by $\\delta_{y}$, and $g$ and $h$ by 0 , viz., \\begin{equation*} a(w, g)=\\left(w, \\delta_{y}\\right)=w(y) \\tag{1.10.10} \\end{equation*} Equation (1.10.10) holds for all continuous $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$. The square-integrability of derivatives of functions $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$ actually implies the continuity of all $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by a well-known theorem in analysis due to Sobolev. (This result is true only in one dimension. The square-integrability of second derivatives is also required to ensure the continuity of functions defined on two- and three-dimensional domains.) Theorem. $u^{h}\\left(x_{A}\\right)=u\\left(x_{A}\\right), A=1,2, \\ldots, n+1$ (i.e., $u^{h}$ is exact at the nodes). To prove the theorem, we need to establish two preliminary results. Lemma 1. $a\\left(u-u^{h}, w^{h}\\right)=0$ for all $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$.\\\\ Proof. We have observed previously that $\\mathcal{U}^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}$, so we may replace $w$ by $w^{h}$ in the variational equation: \\begin{equation*} a\\left(w^{h}, u\\right)=\\left(w^{h}, f\\right)+w^{h}(0) h \\tag{1.10.11} \\end{equation*} Equation (1.10.11) holds for all $w^{h} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$. Recall that the Galerkin equation is identical to (1.10.11) except that $u^{h}$ appears instead of $u$. Subtracting the Galerkin equation\\\\ from (1.10.11) and using the bilinearity and symmetry of $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ yields the required result. Lemma 2. $u(y)-u^{h}(y)=a\\left(u-u^{h}, g\\right)$, where $g$ is the Green's function.\\\\ Proof $$ \\begin{aligned} u(y)-u^{h}(y) & =\\left(u-u^{h}, \\delta_{y}\\right) & & \\text { (definition of } \\left.\\delta_{y}\\right) \\\\ & =a\\left(u-u^{h}, g\\right) & & \\text { (by (1.10.10)) } \\end{aligned} $$ Note that line 2 is true since $u-u^{h}$ is in $\\mathcal{U}$.\\\\ Proof of Theorem. As we have remarked previously, if $y=x_{A}$, a node, $g \\in \\mathcal{U}^{h}$. Let us take this to be the case. Then $$ \\begin{aligned} u\\left(x_{A}\\right)-u^{h}\\left(x_{A}\\right) & =a\\left(u-u^{h}, g\\right) & & \\text { (Lemma 2) } \\\\ & =0 & & \\text { (Lemma 1) } \\end{aligned} $$ The theorem is valid for $A=1,2, \\ldots, n+1$. Strang and Fix [6] attribute this argument to Douglas and Dupont. Results of this kind, embodying exceptional accuracy characteristics, are often referred to as superconvergence phenomena. However, the reader should appreciate that, in more complicated situations, we will not be able, in practice, to guarantee nodal exactness. Nevertheless, as we shall see later on, weighted residual procedures provide a framework within which optimal accuracy properties of some sort may often be guaranteed.\n",

The reader should make sure that he or she has a complete understanding of these ideas as they subsequently arise in other contexts. We begin by introducing some preliminary mathematical results. \\subsection*{Taylor's Formula with Remainder} Let $f:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ possess $k$ continuous derivatives and let $y$ and $z$ be two points in $[0,1]$. Then there is a point $c$ between $y$ and $z$ such that \\begin{align*} f(z) = & f(y) + (z-y) f_{,x}(y) + \\frac{1}{2}(z-y)^{2} f_{,xx}(y) \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{3!}(z-y)^{3} f_{,xxx}(y) + \\cdots + \\tag{1.10.12} \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{k!}(z-y)^{k} f_{,\\underbrace{x \\dots x}_{k \\text{ times}}}(c) \\end{align*} The proof of this formula may be found in [7]. Equation (1.10.12) is sometimes called a finite Taylor expansion. \\subsection*{Mean-Value Theorem} The mean-value theorem is a special case of (1.10.12) which is valid as long as $k \\geq 1$ (i.e., $f$ is continuously differentiable): \\begin{equation*} f(z)=f(y)+(z-y) f_{, x}(c) \\tag{1.10.13} \\end{equation*} Consider a typical subinterval $\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$.

      "chunk word length: 279, chunk char length: 2009, chunk = To determine what (1.10.17) tells us about the accuracy of the derivatives, we wish to think of the situation in which the mesh is being systematically refined (i.e., we let $h_{A}$ approach zero). In this case $h_{A}^{2}$ will be much smaller than $h_{A}$. Thus, for a given $u$, if the right-hand side of $(1.10 .17)$ is $O\\left(h_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}\\right),{ }^{3}$ the error in the derivatives will be much smaller than if the right-hand side is only $O\\left(h_{A}\\right)$. The exponent of $h_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is called the order of convergence or order of accuracy. In the former case we would have second-order convergence of the derivative, whereas in the latter case we would have only first-order convergence. As an example, assume $\\alpha \\rightarrow x_{A}$. Then $$ e_{, x}\\left(x_{A}\\right)=\\frac{h_{A}}{2} u_{, x x}\\left(x_{A}\\right)+\\frac{h_{A}^{2}}{3!} u_{, x x x}\\left(c_{1}\\right)=O\\left(h_{A}\\right) $$ As $\\boldsymbol{h}_{A} \\rightarrow 0$, the first term dominates. (We have seen from the example calculations in Sec. 1.8 that the endpoints of the subintervals are not very accurate for the derivatives.) Clearly any point $\\alpha \\in\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$ achieves first-order accuracy. We are thus naturally led to asking the question, are there any values of $\\alpha$ at which higher-order accuracy is achieved? Corollary. Let $x_{A+1 / 2} \\equiv\\left(x_{A}+x_{A+1}\\right) / 2$ (i.e., the midpoint).

By (1.10.17) $$ e_{, x}\\left(x_{A+1 / 2}\\right)=\\frac{h_{A}^{2}}{48}\\left[u_{, x x x}\\left(c_{1}\\right)+u_{, x x x}\\left(c_{2}\\right)\\right] $$ By the continuity of $u_{1 x x x}$, there is at least one point $c$ between $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ such that $$ u_{. x x x}(c)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[u_{, x x x}\\left(c_{1}\\right)+u_{, x x x}\\left(c_{2}\\right)\\right] $$ Combining these facts completes the proof.\n",

      "chunk word length: 527, chunk char length: 3532, chunk = It is important for anyone who wishes to do finite element analysis to become familiar with the efficient and sophisticated computer schemes that arise in the finite element method. It is felt that the best way to do this is to begin with the simplest scheme, perform some hand calculations, and gradually increase the sophistication as time goes on. To do some of the problems we will need a fairly efficient method of solving matrix equations by hand. The following scheme is applicable to systems of equations\\\\ $\\boldsymbol{K} \\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{F}$ in which no pivoting (i.e., reordering) is necessary. For example, symmetric, positive-definite coefficient matrices never require pivoting. The procedure is as follows: \\subsection*{Gauss Elimination} \\begin{itemize} \\item Solve the first equation for $d_{1}$ and elminate $d_{1}$ from the remaining $n-1$ equations. \\item Solve the second equation for $d_{2}$ and eliminate $d_{2}$ from the remaining $n-2$ equations. \\item Solve the $n-1$ st equation for $d_{n-1}$ and eliminate $d_{n-1}$ from the $n$th equation. \\item Solve the $n$-th equation for $d_{n}$. \\end{itemize} The preceding steps are called forward reduction. The original matrix is reduced to upper triangular form. For example, suppose we began with a system of four equations as follows: $$ \\left[\\begin{array}{llll} K_{11} & K_{12} & K_{13} & K_{14} \\\\ K_{21} & K_{22} & K_{23} & K_{24} \\\\ K_{31} & K_{32} & K_{33} & K_{34} \\\\ K_{41} & K_{42} & K_{43} & K_{44} \\end{array}\\right]\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} d_{1} \\\\ d_{2} \\\\ d_{3} \\\\ d_{4} \\end{array}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} F_{1} \\\\ F_{2} \\\\ F_{3} \\\\ F_{4} \\end{array}\\right\\} $$ The augmented matrix corresponding to this system is \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc|c} K_{11} & K_{12} & K_{13} & K_{14} & F_1 \\\\ K_{21} & K_{22} & K_{23} & K_{24} & F_2 \\\\ K_{31} & K_{32} & K_{33} & K_{34} & F_3 \\\\ K_{41} & K_{42} & K_{43} & K_{44} & F_4 \\\\ \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{\\underbrace{\\phantom{K_{11}\\, K_{12}\\, K_{13}\\, K_{14}}}_{K}} & \\underbrace{\\phantom{F_1}}_{F} \\end{array} \\right] \\] After the forward reduction, the augmented matrix becomes\\\\ \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 & K'_{12} & K'_{13} & K‘_{14} & F'_1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & K'_{23} & K'_{24} & F'_2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & K'_{34} & F'_3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & d_4 \\\\ \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{\\underbrace{\\phantom{K_{11}\\, K_{12}\\, K_{13}\\, K_{14}}}_{U}} & \\underbrace{\\phantom{F_1}}_{F'} \\end{array} \\tag{1.11.1} \\right] \\] corresponding to the upper triangular system $\\boldsymbol{U} \\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\prime} \\cdot{ }^{4}$ It is a simply verified fact that if $\\boldsymbol{K}$ is banded, then $\\boldsymbol{U}$ will be also. Employing the reduced augmented matrix, proceed as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item Eliminate $d_{n}$ from equations $n-1, n-2, \\ldots, 1$.\\\\ \\footnotetext{${ }^{4} \\text{Primes will be used to denote intermediate quantities throughout this section}.$} \\item Eliminate $d_{n-1}$ from equations $n-2, n-3, \\ldots, 1$. \\item Eliminate $d_{2}$ from the first equation. \\end{itemize} This procedure is called back substitution. For example, in the example just given, after back substitution we obtain\\\\ \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d_1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & d_2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & d_3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & d_4 \\\\ \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{\\underbrace{\\phantom{K_{11}\\, K_{12}\\, K_{13}\\, K_{14}}}_{I}} & \\underbrace{\\phantom{F_1}}_{d} \\end{array} \\tag{1.11.2} \\right] \\] corresponding to the identity $1 \\boldsymbol{d}=\\boldsymbol{d}$.

Now reduce the second column \\begin{itemize} \\item Divide row 2 by $K_{22}^{\\prime \\prime}$. \\item Subtract $K_{32}^{\\prime \\prime} \\times$ row 2 from row 3. \\item Subtract $K_{42}^{n} \\times$ row 2 from row 4. \\item Subtract $K_{n 2}^{\\prime \\prime} \\times$ row 2 from row $n$. \\end{itemize} The result for the example will look like\\\\ $\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}1 & \\boldsymbol{K}_{12}^{\\prime} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{13}^{\\prime} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{14}^{\\prime} & \\boldsymbol{F}_{1}^{\\prime} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\boldsymbol{K}_{23}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{24}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} & \\boldsymbol{F}_{2}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{33}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{34}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} & \\boldsymbol{F}_{3}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{43}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} & \\boldsymbol{K}_{44}^{\\prime \\prime\\prime} & \\boldsymbol{F}_{4}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} \\\\ & & & & \\end{array}\\right]$ Note that only the submatrix enclosed in dashed lines is affected in this procedure.\\\\ Repeat until columns 3 to $n$ are reduced and the upper triangular form (1.11.1) is obtained. \\subsection*{Back substitution} \\begin{itemize} \\item Subtract $K_{n-1, n}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n$ from row $n-1$. \\item Subtract $K_{n-2, n}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n$ from row $n-2$.\\\\ \\vdots \\item Subtract $K_{1, n}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n$ from row 1 \\end{itemize} After these steps the augmented matrix, for this example, will look like $$ \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c} 1 & \\bar{K}_{12}^{\\prime} & \\bar{K}_{3}^{\\prime} & 0 & F_{1}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime \\prime} \\\\ 0 & 1 & K_{23}^{\\prime} & 0 & F_{2}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime \\prime} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & d_{3} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & d_{4} \\end{array}\\right] $$ Note that the submatrix enclosed in dashed lines is unaffected by these steps, and, aside from zeroing the appropriate elements of the last column of the coefficient matrix, only the vector $F^{\\prime}$ is altered. Now clear the second-to-last column in the coefficient matrix: \\begin{itemize} \\item Subtract $K_{n-2, n-1}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n-1$ from row $n-2$. \\item Subtract $K_{n-3, n-1}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n-1$ from row $n-3$.\\\\ \\vdots \\item Subtract $K_{1 . n-1}^{\\prime} \\times$ row $n-1$ from row 1. \\end{itemize} Again we mention that the only nontrivial calculations are being performed on the last column (i.e., on $\\boldsymbol{F}$ ).

The result is (1.11.2). \\subsection*{Remarks} \\begin{enumerate} \\item In passing we note that the above procedure is not the same as the way one would implement Gauss elimination on a computer, which we shall treat later. In a computer program for Gauss elimination of symmetric matrices we would want all intermediate results to retain symmetry and thus save storage. This can be done by a small change in the procedure. However, it is felt that the given scheme is the clearest for hand calculations. \\item The numerical example with which we close this section illustrates the preceding elimination scheme.

      "chunk word length: 771, chunk char length: 5825, chunk = So far we have viewed the finite element method simply as a particular Galerkin approximation procedure applied to the weak statement of the problem in question. What makes what we have done a finite element procedure is the character of the selected basis functions; particularly their piecewise smoothness and \"local support\" (i.e., $N_{A}=0$ outside a neighborhood of node $A$ ). This is the mathematical point of view; it is a global point of view in that the basis functions are considered to be defined everywhere on the domain of the boundary-value problem. The global viewpoint is useful in establishing the mathematical properties of the finite element method. This can be seen in Sec. 1.10 and will be made more apparent later on. Now we wish to discuss another point of view called the local, or element, point of view. This viewpoint is the traditional one in engineering and is useful in the computer implementation of the finite element method and in the development of finite elements. We begin our treatment of the local point of view with a question: What is a finite element? We shall attempt to give the answer in terms of the piecewise linear finite element space that we defined previously. An individual element consists of the following quantities. Linear finfte element (global description) \\begin{center} \\begin{tabular}{lll} $(g 1)$ & Domain: & $\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$ \\\\ $(g 2)$ & Nodes: & $\\left\\{x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right\\}$ \\\\ $(g 3)$ & Degrees of freedom: & $\\left\\{d_{A}, d_{A+1}\\right\\}$ \\\\ $(g 4)$ & Shape functions: & $\\left\\{N_{A}, N_{A+1}\\right\\}$ \\\\ $(g 5)$ & Interpolation function: & \\\\ $u^{h}(x)=N_{A}(x) d_{A}+N_{A+1}(x) d_{A+1}$, & $x \\in\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$ & \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\end{center} (Recall $d_{A}=u^{h}\\left(x_{A}\\right)$.) In words, a linear finite element is just the totality of paraphemalia associated with the globally defined function $u^{h}$ restricted to the element domain. The above quantities are in terms of global parameters-namely, the global coordinates, global shape functions, global node ordering, and so on. It is fruitful to introduce a local set of quantities, corresponding to the global ones, so that calculations for a typical element may be standardized. These are given as follows: Linear finite element (local description)\\\\ (l1) Domain: $\\left[\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}\\right]$ \\footnotetext{${ }^{5}$ In weighted residual methods in which $g^{h}$ and $\\sigma^{N}$ are built up from different classes of functions (i.e., Petrov-Galerkin methods), we would also have to specify a set of weighting functions, say\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-37} } (l2) Nodes: $\\left\\{\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}\\right\\}$\\\\ (l3) Degrees of freedom: $\\left\\{d_{1}, d_{2}\\right\\}$\\\\ (I4) Shape functions: $\\left\\{N_{1}, N_{2}\\right\\}$\\\\ (15) Interpolation function: $$ u^{h}(\\xi)=N_{1}(\\xi) d_{1}+N_{2}(\\xi) d_{2} $$ Note that in the local description, the nodal numbering begins with 1.\\\\ We shall relate the domains of the global and local descriptions by an \"affine\" transformation $\\xi:\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right] \\rightarrow\\left[\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}\\right]$, such that $\\xi\\left(x_{A}\\right)=\\xi_{1}$ and $\\xi\\left(x_{A+1}\\right)=\\xi_{2}$. It is standard practice to take $\\xi_{1}=-1$ and $\\xi_{2}=+1$. Thus $\\xi$ may be represented by the expression \\begin{equation*} \\xi(x)=c_{1}+c_{2} x \\tag{1.12.1} \\end{equation*} where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants which are determined by \\[ \\left.\\begin{array}{rl} -1 & =c_{1}+x_{A} c_{2} \\tag{1.12.2}\\\\ 1 & =c_{1}+x_{A+1} c_{2} \\end{array}\\right\\} \\] Solving this system yields \\begin{equation*} \\xi(x)=\\frac{2 x-x_{A}-x_{A+1}}{h_{A}} \\tag{1.12.3} \\end{equation*} (Recall $h_{A}=x_{A+1}-x_{A}$.) The inverse of $\\xi$ is obtained by solving for $x$ : \\begin{equation*} x(\\xi)=\\frac{h_{A} \\xi+x_{A}+x_{A+1}}{2} \\tag{1.12.4} \\end{equation*} In (1.12.1), $\\xi$ is a mapping and $x$ is a point, whereas in (1.12.4), $x$ is a mapping and $\\xi$ is a point. In the sequel, we adopt the notational convention that subscripts $a, b, c, \\ldots$ pertain to the local numbering system. The subscripts $A, B, C, \\ldots$ will always pertain to the global numbering system. To control the proliferation of notations, we will frequently use the same notation for the local and global systems (e.g., $d_{a}$ and $d_{A}$ or $N_{a}$ and $N_{A}$ ). This generally should not cause confusion as the context will make clear which point of view is being adopted. If there is danger of confusion, a superscript $e$ will be introduced to denote a quantity in the local description associated with element number $e$ (e.g., $d_{a}^{e}=d_{A}, N_{a}^{e}(\\xi)=N_{A}\\left(x^{e}(\\xi)\\right)$, where $x^{e}:\\left[\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}\\right] \\rightarrow$ $\\left[x_{1}^{e}, x_{2}^{e}\\right]=\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$, etc.). In terms of $\\xi$, the shape functions in the local description take on a standard form \\begin{equation*} N_{a}(\\xi)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\xi_{a} \\xi\\right), \\quad a=1,2 \\tag{1.12.5} \\end{equation*} Note also that (1.12.4) may be written in terms of (1.12.5): \\begin{equation*} x^{e}(\\xi)=\\sum_{a=1}^{2} N_{a}(\\xi) x_{a}^{e} \\tag{1.12.6} \\end{equation*} This has the same form as the interpolation function (cf. 15).\\\\ For future reference, we note the following results: \\begin{gather*} N_{a, \\xi}=\\frac{\\xi_{a}}{2}=\\frac{(-1)^{a}}{2} \\tag{1.12.7}\\\\ x_{, \\xi}^{e}=\\frac{h^{e}}{2} \\tag{1.12.8} \\end{gather*} where $h^{e}=x_{2}^{e}-x_{1}^{e}$ and \\begin{equation*} \\xi_{, x}^{e}=\\left(x_{, \\xi}^{e}\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{2}{h^{e}} \\tag{1.12.9} \\end{equation*} The local and global descriptions of the eth element are depicted in Fig. 1.12.1.\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-39} Figure 1.12.1 Local and global descriptions of the $e$ th element.\n",

The dimensions of LM are $n_{\\text {en }}$, the number of element nodes, by the number of elements; in the present case, the numbers are 2 and $n_{e l}$, respectively.

We shall see that this is generally true, and hence these computations may be done once and for all. The derivatives $\\boldsymbol{x}_{, \\xi}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{, x}$ do depend on the particular element data (in the present case $h^{e}$ ), and subroutines will be necessary to compute the analogs of these quantities in more general cases. Now we wish to compute $f^{e}$. However, this cannot be done without explicitly knowing what $f=\\boldsymbol{f}(x)$ is. In practice, it would be inconvenient to reprogram every time we wanted to solve a problem involving a different function $f$. Generally a convenient approximation is made. For example, we might replace $f$ by its linear interpolate over each element, namely, \\begin{equation*} f^{h}=\\sum_{a=1}^{2} f_{a} N_{a} \\tag{1.15.4} \\end{equation*} where $f_{a}=f\\left(x\\left(\\xi_{a}\\right)\\right)$; see Fig. 1.15.1. The notation $f^{h}$ is used to indicate that the approximation depends upon the mesh. This represents an approximation that is sufficient for most practical applications. (It is, of course, exact for constant or linear \"loading\" of the element.) Now standardization of input to the program may be facilitated; that is, the nodal values of $f$ are the required data. Let us employ this approximation in the explicit calculation of an element force vector: \\begin{align*} \\int_{\\Omega^{e}} N_{a}(x) f^{h}(x) d x & =\\int_{-1}^{+1} N_{a}(x(\\xi)) f^{h}(x(\\xi)) x_{, \\xi}(\\xi) d \\xi \\quad \\text { (change of variables) } \\\\ & =\\frac{h^{e}}{2} \\sum_{b=1}^{2} \\int_{-1}^{+1} N_{a}(\\xi) N_{b}(\\xi) d \\xi f_{b} \\quad \\text { (by (1.12.8)) } \\tag{1.15.5} \\end{align*} \\begin{center} \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-45} \\end{center} Figure 1.15.1 Approximation of $/$ by piecewise linear interpolation of nodal values.

On each subinterval, show that $w^{h}$ may be written as $$ w^{h}(x)=N_{1}(x) w^{h}\\left(x_{1}\\right)+N_{3}(x) w^{h}\\left(x_{2}\\right)+N_{2}(x) w_{. x}^{h}\\left(x_{1}\\right)+N_{4}(x) w_{, x}^{h}\\left(x_{2}\\right) $$ where $$ \\begin{aligned} & N_{1}(x)=\\frac{-\\left(x-x_{2}\\right)^{2}\\left[-h+2\\left(x_{1}-x\\right)\\right]}{h^{3}} \\\\ & N_{2}(x)=\\frac{\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)^{\\prime}\\left(x-x_{2}\\right)^{2}}{h^{2}} \\\\ & N_{3}(x)=\\frac{\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)^{2}\\left[h+2\\left(x_{2}-x\\right)\\right]}{h^{3}} \\\\ & N_{4}(x)=\\frac{\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-x_{2}\\right)}{h^{2}} \\end{aligned} $$ Hint: Let $w^{h}(x)=c_{1}+c_{2} x+c_{3} x^{2}+c_{4} x^{3}$, where the $c^{\\prime}$ s are constants. Determine them by requiring the following four conditions hold: $$ \\begin{aligned} w^{h}\\left(x_{1}\\right) & =c_{1}+c_{2} x_{1}+c_{3} x_{1}^{2}+c_{4} x_{1}^{3} \\\\ w^{h}\\left(x_{2}\\right) & =c_{1}+c_{2} x_{2}+c_{3} x_{2}^{2}+c_{4} x_{2}^{3} \\\\ w_{,x}^{h}\\left(x_{1}\\right) & =c_{2}+2 c_{3} x_{1}+3 c_{4} x_{1}^{2} \\\\ w_{,x}^{h}\\left(x_{2}\\right) & =c_{2}+2 c_{3} x_{2}+3 c_{4} x_{2}^{2} \\end{aligned} $$ \\footnote{${ }^{8}$ The notation $w^{k} \\in C^{1}$ means $w^{k}$ is continuously differentiable.} Sketch the element functions $N_{1}, N_{2}, N_{3}$, and $N_{4}$, and their typical global counterparts. The finite element space described in part (b) results in exact nodal displacements and slopes (first derivatives), analogous to the case presented in Sec. 1.10. In part ( g ), you are asked to prove this. In problems of beam bending we are generally interested in curvatures (second derivatives) for bending moment calculations.\\\\ c. Locate the optimal curvature points in the sense of Barlow. Warning: The algebraic manipulations can be tiresome unless certain simplifications are observed. If we work in the $\\xi$-element coordinate system introduced in Sec. 1.12 (recall $\\left.\\xi=\\left(2 x-x_{A}-x_{A+1}\\right) / h_{A}\\right)$, the location of the Barlow curvature points may be expressed as $\\xi= \\pm 1 / \\sqrt{3}$. That is, there are two symmetrically spaced optimal locations to compute curvature.\\\\ d. What is the rate of convergence of curvature at these points? (Ans. $O\\left(h^{3}\\right)$ ).\\\\ e. If the segment of the beam $\\left[x_{A}, x_{A+1}\\right]$ is unloaded (i.e., $u_{, x x x}=0$, where $u$ is the exact solution), which points are optimal?\\\\ f. Assume $n_{e l}=1$ (i.e., one element) and $f(x)=c=$ constant. Set up and solve the Galerkin-finite element equations. Plot $u^{h}$ and $u ; u_{, x}^{h}$ and $u_{, x} ;$ and $u_{, x x}^{h}$ and $u_{, x x}$. Indicate the locations of the Barlow curvature points.\\\\ g. Prove that $$ \\begin{gathered} u^{h}\\left(x_{A}\\right)=u\\left(x_{A}\\right) \\\\ u_{, x}^{h}\\left(x_{A}\\right)=u_{, x}\\left(x_{A}\\right) \\end{gathered} $$ where $x_{A}$ is a typical node (i.e., prove the displacements and slopes are exact at the nodes). To do the second part you will have to be familiar with the dipole, $\\delta_{x}\\left(x-x_{A}\\right)$, which is the generalized derivative of the delta function.\\\\ h. Show that the Barlow curvature points are exact when $f(x)=c=$ constant.\\\\ i. Why do we require that the functions in $\\mathcal{U}^{h}$ have continuous first derivatives?\\\\ j. Calculate the $4 \\times 4$ element stiffness matrix, $$ k_{p q}^{e}=\\int_{x_{1}^{e}}^{x_{2}^{e}} N_{p, x x} E I N_{q, x x} d x \\quad 1 \\leq p, q \\leq 4 $$ where $h^{e}=x_{2}^{e}-x_{1}^{\\mathrm{e}}$.\\\\ k. (See the exercise in Sec. 1.8.) Consider the weak formulation. Assume $w \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $u \\in \\mathfrak{f}$ are smooth on element interiors (i.e., on $] x_{A}, x_{A+1}[$ ) but may exhibit discontinuities in second, and higher, derivatives across element boundaries.

Contrast these results with those obtained for functions $w$ and $u$, which are globally smooth. The Galerkin finite element formulation yields a solution that approximates (i) through (v).\n",

Many of these ideas had to do with the continuity and differentiability of functions. The presentation was, admittedly, somewhat vague on these points in order that the main ideas would not be overencumbered. Careful characterization of the properties of functions is an essential ingredient in the development and analysis of finite element methods. However, to pursue this subject deeply would take us into the realm of serious mathematical analysis, which is outside the scope of this book. Nevertheless, we feel compelled to say a few additional words on the subject to round out the presentation in Chapter 1 and to expose the reader to notations and ideas that will probably be encountered if he or she attempts to read published papers on finite elements. The discussion here will be restricted to one dimension. In Chapter 1 we spoke of continuously differentiable functions. If we have a grasp of the notion of a continuous function, then continuously differentiable functions pose no problem. Definition: A function $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ (recall $\\Omega=] 0,1[$ is said to be $k$-times continuously differentiable, or of class $C^{k}=C^{k}(\\Omega)$, if its derivatives of order $j$, where $0 \\leq j \\leq k$, exist and are continuous functions. A $C^{0}$ function is simply a continuous function. A $C^{\\infty}$. function is one that possesses a continuous derivative of any order (i.e., $j=0,1, \\ldots, \\infty$ ). Definition: A function $f$ is said to be of class $C_{b}^{k}$ if it is $C^{k}$ and bounded (i.e., $|f(x)|<c$, where $c$ is a constant, for all $x \\in \\Omega$ ). \\subsection*{Example 1} The functions defined by monomials (i.e., $f(x)=1, x, x^{2}$, etc.) are $C_{b}^{\\infty}$. \\subsection*{Example 2} The function $f(x)=1 / x$ is continuous on $\\Omega$, as are all its derivatives; hence it is $C^{\\infty}$, but it is not bounded (i.e., there does not exist a constant $c$ such that $|1 / x|<c$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$; see Fig. 1.I.1). Consequently this function is not of class $C_{b}^{k}$ for any $k \\geq 0$.\\\\ \\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2024_10_04_fba7dc36d090c246379ag-53} Figure 1.I. 1 A continuous function that is not bounded. \\subsection*{Example 3} The function \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases}x, & x \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\tag{1.I.1}\\\\ 1 / 2, & x>\\frac{1}{2}\\end{cases} \\] is continuous but not continuously differentiable (i.e., it is $C_{b}^{0}$ but not $C_{b}{ }^{1}$ ). Punctions in $C_{b}^{k}, k \\geq 1$, but not in $C_{b}^{k+1}$ may be constructed by integrating (1.I.1) $k$ times. For example, \\[ f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{x^{2}}{2}, & x \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\tag{1.I.2}\\\\ \\frac{\\left(x-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{2}, & x>\\frac{1}{2} \\end{array}\\right. \\] is in $C_{b}^{1}$ but not $C_{b}^{2}$. (The reader may wish to verify this.) There is no universally accepted definition of what is meant by a \"smooth\" function. However, it is generally taken to mean that at least one derivative exists and is continuous (i.e., either $C^{1}$ or $C_{b}^{l}$ ) and sometimes means $k>1$, even $\\infty$. The $C^{k}$ and $C_{b}^{k}$ functions employ the classical notion of a derivative in their definitions. If we employ the closed unit interval, $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}=[0,1]$, instead of $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}=] 0,1[$, the difference between $C^{k}$ and $C_{b}^{k}$ disappears. This is because if $f$ is $C^{k}([0,1]), f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are real numbers and are not allowed to be $\\infty$. Thus unboundedness, as in the example above, is precluded. Very often, we think of $C^{k}$ functions in this light. However, in some situations the differences between $C^{k}(\\Omega)$ and $C_{b}^{k}(\\Omega)$ must be kept in mind. Generally, finite element functions are smooth on element interiors (there are exceptions, however) but possess only low-order continuity across element boundaries. One might be tempted to characterize them as locally smooth but globally \"rough.\" The piecewise linear finite element functions discussed in Sec. 1.8 are of class $C_{b}^{0}$. The Hermite cubics employed in Sec. 1.16 are $C_{b}^{1}$. To calculate derivatives of such functions we need to employ the notion of a \"generalized derivative,\" as was used in solving the Green's function problem of Sec. 1.10. For example, the first derivative of a piecewise linear finite element function is a generalized step function; the second derivative is a generalized Dirac delta function (i.e., delta functions, of various amplitudes, acting at the nodes). In the case of the Hermite cubics, the first derivative is continuous, the second a generalized step function, and so on. We have seen in Sec. 1.16 that other generalized functions also arise in the analysis of finite element behavior (namely, the dipole). The useful examples of generalized functions are by no means exhausted by what we have seen thus far. However, the ones we have introduced are perhaps the most basic. In the mathematical analysis of boundary-value problems, and consequently in finite element analysis, we need to introduce classes of functions that possess generalized derivatives and, in addition, certain integrability properties. We have encountered such functions in the statements of weak formulations in Sec. 1.3 and 1.16. These are particular examples of Sobolev spaces of functions defined as follows: \\begin{equation*} H^{k}=H^{k}(\\Omega)=\\left\\{w \\mid w \\in L_{2} ; w_{, x} \\in L_{2} ; \\ldots ; \\underbrace{w_{x \\ldots x}}_{\\text{k times}} \\in L_{2}\\right\\} \\tag{1.I.3} \\end{equation*} where \\begin{equation*} L_{2}=L_{2}(\\Omega)=\\left\\{w \\mid \\int_{0}^{1} w^{2} d x<\\infty\\right\\} \\tag{1.I.4} \\end{equation*} In words, the Sobolev space of degree $k$, denoted by $\\boldsymbol{H}^{\\boldsymbol{k}}$, consists of functions that possess square-integrable generalized derivatives through order $k$. A square-integrable function is called an $L_{2}$-function, by virtue of (1.I.4). From (1.I.3), we see that $H^{0}=L_{2}$ and that $H^{k+1} \\subset H^{k}$. The Sobolev spaces are the most important for studying elliptic boundary-value problems. The question naturally arises as to the relation between Sobolev spaces and the classical spaces of differentiable functions introduced previously. In particular, when is an $H^{k}$-function smooth in the classical sense? The answer is provided by Sobolev's theorem, which states that, in one dimension, $H^{k+1} \\subset C_{b}^{k}$. That is, if a function is of class $H^{k+1}$, then it is actually a $C_{b}^{k}$ function. For example, in Sec. 1.3 we required $H^{1}$ functions. By Sobolev's theorem, such functions are, additionally, continuous and bounded. In Sec 1.16, we employed $H^{2}$ functions. These are $C_{b}^{1}$ by Sobolev's theorem and thus possess bounded, continuous, classical derivatives. Certain \"singularities\" are precluded by square-integrability. For example, $x^{-1 / 4}$ is in $L_{2}$, but $x^{-1 / 2}$ is not. (Verify!) Such considerations become important in many physical circumstances (e.g., in fracture mechanics). The number of other types of function spaces that arise in mathematical analysis is large, and many are difficult to comprehend without serious training in \"functional analysis.\" These topics are outside the scope of this book.

      "forces acting on it. If $f$ is positive, it indicates a downward force, causing the string to sag, while if $f$ is negative, it represents an upward force,\n",
      "which would tend to lift the string.  2. **Longitudinal Displacement of an Elastic Rod**: For an elastic rod, the equation similarly describes the longitudinal\n",
      "displacement $u$ along the length of the rod. Here, $u_{,xx}$ represents the axial deformation of the rod, which is influenced by the internal stresses and\n",
      "external forces. The term $f$ again represents an external force per unit length acting on the rod. The equation indicates that the internal deformation (or\n",
